        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="introductary_text">Hello! My name is Robert Heaton and I am
          an undergraduate Mechatronics Engineer from Preston, England, and I am
          currently studying at the University of
          Manchester. This website is a platform to showcase my work and skills, 
          and a copy of my CV can be found at the bottom of the site in 
          <a href="#contactInfo" target="_blank">
            Contact Information</a>.
          I have always enjoyed electronics and embedded systems,
          developing a liking for robotics and autonomous systems in my first
          year of study, thus becomming naturally enthralled by the field of
          mechatronics. I enjoy reading, jigsaws, history, electronics projects,
           shooting, poetry, video games, rock-climbing, video editing,
            and wood and metal working.
          <div class="subSpace">
            It is my philosophy that any system can be improved and any problem
            overcome. I believe that any individual, big or small, can have a
            huge impact and
            should strive to better themselves and their environment.
             It is very important that a modern engineer is ethical
            in thier work and operates sustainably, and so this is always a
            consideration of mine when undertaking any work. To myself, the role
             of
            an engineer therefore involves applying scientific principles in a
            consciensious manner with the purpose to better mankind.

          <div class="subSpace">
            I consider myself a natural leader and enjoy working on projects,
            whether in a group or in an individual scope. Others would consider
            me a good listener and strong decision maker capable of action or
            caution depending on whichever the situation calls for. I am good
            at delegating work to people's strengths, and am not afraid to seek
            advise on subjects that are not my speciality. I often like to
            automate repative tasks and experiment with using mechatronics to
            optimise processes around me, drawing inspiration from personal
            experience and a vision of what can be. I am always trying to learn
            new things, such as the HTML and CSS required to build this site!
